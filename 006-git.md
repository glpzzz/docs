# 006 - Git

## Branch workflow

For each feature is used a dedicated branch. The development of each version is carried out in the specific branches.

Before the first release, main branch is `master` only.

After the first release, `master` branch must rename to `1.x`. For major change must be created a new branch with usage
next version as name (for example, `2.x`). The main branch is the branch with the current stable release.
