# 006 - Git

## Branch workflow

- Create a dedicated branch for each feature. Develop each version in specific branches.
- Before the first release, main branch is `master`.
- After the first release, rename `master` to `1.x`. For a major release, create a new version branch such as `2.x`. The main branch is the branch with the current stable release.

## Commit messages

### Subject line

- Use `#123` to reference issue by number
- Use imperative mood that's `Fix`, not `Fixed`
- Don't add period at the end
- Use `[skip ci]` if there is no need to run unit tests
- Start with a capital letter
- Limit to 50 characters

### Body

Use message body **if** you need an extra explanation. Explain why, not how.
