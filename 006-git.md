# 006 - Git

## Branch workflow

- Create a dedicated branch for each feature. Develop each version in specific branches.
- Before the first release, main branch is `master`.
- After the first release, create a new release branch `1.x` and make it main branch.
- Major changes must create in `master` branch.

## Commit messages
